<h1>PlatformerLevelDesigner</h1>

<h2>Big, Fat Disclaimer</h2>

The idea behind this program was to minimize time spent creating levels for <a href="https://github.com/PlanetLotus/keen5-linux" target="_blank">my platformer</a> that's currently in development. Since "saving time" was the whole idea, this program was rushed. I came up with a quick, tiny design document in a .txt file and then immediately started coding.

Because I'm hosting this publicly, I feel it necessary to state that this code is sloppy, because I wanted to minimize the amount of time I spent working on it and then get back to my game.

In the future, it'd be nice to work on it more and make sure it supports *any* platformer rather than just mine, but for now, the whole point was to save time and not have to hardcode in coordinate values in my game. This is open source, but <strong>I wrote it for me</strong>.

<h2>Description</h2>

This is a very simple, minimalistic level designer for my platformer. It's as simple as loading up a sprite sheet, placing the tiles you want where you want them, then saving it, which creates a file with a specific format that will tell a game where you want each tile placed.
